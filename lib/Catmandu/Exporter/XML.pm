=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Catmandu::Exporter> exports items serialized as XML. Serialization is
implemented based on L<XML::Struct::Writer::Stream>. By default, each item is
written to STDOUT.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over

=item attributes

=item xmldecl

=item encoding

=item version

=item standalone

=item pretty

These options are passed to L<XML::Struct::Writer>. The target (option C<to>)
is based on L<Catmandu::Exporter>'s option C<fh> or C<file>.

=item field

Take XML from a given field of each item, e.g. field C<xml> as following:

    { xml => [ root => { xmlns => 'http://example.org/' }, [ ... ] ] }

=item directory

Serialize to multiple files in a given directory.

=item filename

Field to take filenames from if option C<directory> is set. Defaults to C<_id>.
The file extension C<.xml> is appended unless given.
